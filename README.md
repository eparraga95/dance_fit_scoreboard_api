# Dance Fit Scoreboard API


### The Idea
---

As a Player of [Pump It Up](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_It_Up) at the [Dance Fit Gaming House](https://www.instagram.com/dancefitgaming.house/) myself, and in the need to find some real life problem to get motivated to code, alongside with the DFH Staff we had the idea to come up with an app to create an alternative to the current process of registering, mantaining and processing the data that is provided by the players to create their championships and ranking systems. What happens as of today, is that a Player takes a picture of the PIU machine's score screen and a championship staff has to manually add it to a datasheet to be rendered on a front.

This project has the intention to be the API the will serve a new web application desingned to take this manual work from the hands of the championship's staffs and put it in the hands of the players and give the staffs only the job to validate each score that was registered by their owners (players).

The idea is to make it possible so a player can send a picture of their scores as the real source of truth via front end alongside with the other score details to make it so the staffs jobs are only to review and validate each score, update it or delete it as needed.
